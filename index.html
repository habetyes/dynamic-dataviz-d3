          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smokers and Income, Obesity</h2>
          <p>Recent Census data has appeared to show what, to some, may be some surprising correlations. Surely most people understand
            the health risks associated with smoking, however, recent Census data seems to show a surprising correlation between smoking
            and a couple of other individual measures.
          </p>

          <p>Considering the high price of cigarettes as well as the sometimes hefty additional taxes placed on them, it would seems
            that smoking is a luxury for those who are more well off. Somewhat surprisingly, data shows that those with lower incomes are more 
            likely to be smokers. This could be due to the additional stress experienced by those who feel a stronger financial burden, and
          find a bit of relief in smoking.</p>

          <p>Additionally, while we are far from the days of lobbyist exhalting the benefits of smoking, most of us know the health risks
            in the form of lung cancer and respiratory illnesses. What is interesting in the Census data set is that smoking looks to have 
          a correlation with obesity. This could likely be a secondary effect as smokers have a lower lung capacity they tend to avoid as 
        much physical activity. With a more sedentary lifestyle, obesity is much more likely to occur.</p>
